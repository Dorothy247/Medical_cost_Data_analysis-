                                                   ### Insurance Data Analysis Project
 ### Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and visualize real-world data using Python. I worked with an insurance dataset to uncover insights about factors influencing insurance charges, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region.

The goal of this project is to showcase data analysis, visualization, and storytelling skills, which are essential for roles in data analysis, business intelligence, and Python development.

### Technologies and Tools

Python 3 – Programming language used for data analysis

Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive coding and exploration

### Key Features

Data Exploration

Inspected dataset structure and data types

Identified and handled missing values

Basic Data Analysis

Computed summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)

Grouped data by categorical columns (e.g., smoker, region) to compute average insurance charges

Identified patterns impacting insurance costs

### Data Visualization

Line chart: Average insurance charges by age

Bar chart: Comparison of charges by smoker status

Histogram: Distribution of BMI

Scatter plot: Relationship between age and charges, highlighting smokers vs. non-smokers

### Insights

Smokers pay significantly higher insurance charges than non-smokers

Older individuals generally have higher insurance costs

BMI distribution shows most policyholders fall within the healthy to overweight range

Region has an impact, but smoking status is the strongest factor affecting charges
